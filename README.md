# Files_organizer
Python script to organise files in desktop based on extentions
Limitatations:
1. Can work on Windows only for now
2. Currently works on path provided only and ignores the directories in it(if you want to go into directories further remove the last break statement)! Not tested and can result in various tragedies

Requirements:
Python 3.x

Keep the py files in the same folder as of the folder to organise
